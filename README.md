# shopsoft

An ecommerce web app.

## Background

Shopsoft is the final project for my Fall 2023 Software Engineering I class. The requirements were to make an ecommerce web application where customers could register, view listings, add items to their cart, and communicate with staff about their orders. Staff could track and update inventory as well as communicate with each other. We also had to use UML to design the app's architecture, the Waterfall methodology to create it, and git for version control. Shopsoft meets those requirements. Note that making the app pretty with CSS was not required.

This app was built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com), a web applciation framework for Python, and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), a lightweight, simple database engine.
